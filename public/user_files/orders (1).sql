I have nothing but positive feedback on being a student at University of District of Columbia. \n\nMs.Wiggleton has a deep passion for helping children to succeed and always had made a great effort to prepare for her studies as a student at UDC. She has taken her role very seriously and is passionate about pursuing her Associate in Arts where she successfully ended that chapter December 2022.\n\nWe shared several courses together while we both were studying Early Childhood Education and I also learned that we both share the same passion working with young children. However, what I love about Ms.Wiggleton is that she has a very effective personality and we frequently consulted about several subjects. \n\nFor instance, we would debate about culture and politics. Where Ms. Wiggleton would explain with facts and examples. We would talk about strategies on how to help children with ADHD and Ms.Wiggleton happens to know a great deal about that subject. \nMs.Wiggleton is someone who will take ownership of her role and works well with other classmates especially during our group projects. She has always been fair and compassionate no matter who she is addressing, child or adult.\n\nI have the deepest personal and professional respect for Miss Wiggleton, and sincerely believe she will bring her unique energy, optimism, and passion to Trinity Washington University. She has my highest endorsement.
